A piece of sky 

Broke off and fell 

Through the crack in the ceiling 

Right into my soup, 

KERPLOP! 

I really must state 
That I usually hate 
Lentil soup, but I ate 
Every drop! 

Delicious delicious 
(A bit like plaster). 

But so delicious, goodness sake --

I could have eaten a lentil-soup lake. 
It's amazing the difference 
A bit of sky can make.
